Day 12 Part 2: Garden Fencing with Bulk Discount

Key Insight: Number of sides = Number of corners in a polygon

Approach:
1. BFS to find all connected regions of same plant type
2. For each region, count corners (not perimeter like part 1)
3. Corner counting:
   - Each grid point can be surrounded by 0-4 cells from the region
   - Check each unique corner point only once (deduplicate!)
   - Count based on pattern of surrounding cells:
     * 0 or 4 cells: 0 corners (exterior or interior point)
     * 1 or 3 cells: 1 corner (outer/inner corner)
     * 2 cells diagonal: 2 corners (two regions touching diagonally)
     * 2 cells adjacent: 0 corners (just an edge)
4. Price = area Ã— corners for each region
